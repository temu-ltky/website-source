We mainly accept degree students of LUT-concern as our actual members. Alumnus or staff of LUT-concern may apply as a senior member. The board may also exceptionally accept other individuals interested in music as actual members, if this is pleaded from the board in a written form.

TeMu ry’s annual membership fee is 10€.

You can join TeMu ry by purchasing the membership from our Holvi webstore.

After this we recommend filling out the [Pommari access form](https://forms.gle/W7JdrSnwFALMQKRn7/) which the board will process and using its own judgment grant access to pommari and the reservation calendar.
